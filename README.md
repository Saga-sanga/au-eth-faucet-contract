# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Contract Address: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xD0483297b6E459898a0fa7Ce2f169537f3D65c20](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xD0483297b6E459898a0fa7Ce2f169537f3D65c20)
